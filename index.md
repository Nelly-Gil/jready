My name is Nelly Dayan Gil, and I am the a third-year Economics student with a Financial Emphasis and a Computer Science Minor at Northern Illinois University.

I am a driven economics major at Northern Illinois University with a strong foundation in finance, analytical modeling, and business strategy. Experienced in applying financial concepts through hands-on coursework and internship preparation, with growing skills in data analysis and computer science. I am focused on developing a career in wealth management, supported by strong communication abilities, a proactive work ethic, and a commitment to continuous growth.

### Background

I was born in Palmira, Colombia and joined the NIU family when I was three months old. I come from a line of champion dogs known for their great temperaments and love for children. My breeder gave me special training to prepare me for my important role as a university mascot.

Before coming to NIU, I received early socialization training to help me adapt to various situations. This included exposure to hats, coats, loud noises, and other novel experiences. I'm known for my bravery and eagerness to try new things, which are essential qualities for a mascot who often faces unexpected situations.

When I'm not representing NIU at events, I enjoy playing with my toys, going for walks around campus, and meeting new people. I'm looking forward to fully stepping into my role and becoming an integral part of the Huskie Nation!
