Welcome to my website! I created this space to share my journey, my work, and my passion for growth, financial literacy, and personal development. My goal is to connect with others who are driven by ambition, curiosity, and the desire to build a better future for themselves and the people around them.


### Background

I’m a junior at Northern Illinois University majoring in Economics with a Financial Emphasis and minoring in Computer Science. I’m currently building experience in financial analysis, business strategy, and valuation through internships, mentorship, and real-world projects. I’m passionate about a future career in finance and wealth management, and one of my biggest goals is to help others understand financial literacy so they can gain independence and personal freedom.

I was born in Palmira, Colombia and came to the United States with my mother when I was just over a year old. Being a first-generation immigrant and the firstborn daughter shaped my values—responsibility, ambition, and the desire to create opportunity not only for myself, but for the people around me. Those early experiences fuel my drive and inspire my vision for the future.

Outside of academics and career development, I’m always working on growing as a person. I love challenging myself in the gym, learning new ideas in philosophy and technology, and exploring content creation and coding. I also really love animals—I have three big dogs—and I never say no to a good cup of coffee (it’s a Colombian thing).

I have big goals for my future, including leading a company one day as a CEO. I believe in building a life through mindset, learning, and discipline—and I’m excited to share that journey with others.
