### Prompt ###
*"What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally. Have you used them before? What surprised you about Markdown or Git?"*

### What I learned about Markdown and Git ###
  Markdown ended up surprising me the most. I thought that it would be an overly complicated coding language that I would be struggling to learn, but it has been quite simple so far. By using a few characters like a '#', '*', '-', or other characters, I can alter the headers, make lists, and provide links to websites or images. I learned that Markdown is used everywhere too, not just in the technology industry. What I have learned to like the most from using Markdown is that it makes my writing look clean and professional-like without me having to look for formatting buttons--I can just use my keyboard! So far, using Markdown has been straight forward and I can see myself using Markdown outside of this class.
  
  Git, on the other hand, is something that I believe will take some time to understand and see why it is so important. When I first began completing the Microsoft Learning Labs I found it extremely difficult to understand the verbiage that came with Git. Terms like "branches", "commits", and "pull requests", seemed like complete gibberish. Once I continued to use and research Git, it was easy to understand why many use Git to collaborate and work on projects virtually.

  ### How They Have Helped Me Contribute to Open Source and Improve Professionally ###
  So far, I do not believe that learning about Markdown or Git has helped me professionally. Do I believe that if I decide to go into the workforce, knowing a syntax language might be beneficial? Yes. As of right now though, I believe knowing Markdown and Git will only help me do well on this course. Although knowing Markdown and learning about Git has not helped me contribute to Open Source, since I have not worked on any kind of projects as of yet, I can see how I will be able to use both in the future in working on Open Source projects. 

  ### Have You Used Them Before? ###
  I have not used Markdown or Git in the past, but I am excited to learn more about each one.

  ### What Surprised You About Markdown or Git? ###
  What surprised me the most about using Markdown was how little I had to learn to use it. Markdown helps a lot with editing text to the format that you would like. I thought that I would have had to learn a completely knew coding language, but it is a lot easier than that since we mainly use symbols to edit the format of text.

  What surprised me the most about Git was how it goes about saving changes to the work being done on Git. Where most apps or programs might just save one version of a file, Git gives you the entire history of changes that have been made to a project! You can go back and see where you started in a project to where you ended! It is very comforting to know that you are able to experiment while working on a project without the worry of losing all the progress you've already made.
